# Robotics-using-AI


Robotics using AI involves creating robots that can learn, make decisions, and perform tasks by processing data from sensors and their environment. 
Python is a popular language for this, thanks to its ease of use and powerful libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn, which help robots with tasks like object detection, navigation, and learning from data. 
The Anaconda environment simplifies managing these libraries and dependencies, while Spyder, an IDE within Anaconda, makes coding and debugging easier. 
With these tools, robots can be programmed to recognize objects, respond to voice commands, and move autonomously, all powered by AI and Python.
